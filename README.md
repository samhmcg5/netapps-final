# netapps-final
Final Project for Network Application Design

## Python Libraries to Install:
- face_recognition (follow these steps for Raspberry Pi installation: https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65)

## What won't be implemented
We will not create schedules because that would involve a beastly algorithm. If anyone wants to, be my guest. It is also something thats time sensitive so probably could not be demonstrated
